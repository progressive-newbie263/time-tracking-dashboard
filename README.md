<h1>FEMentor Time Tracking Dashboard project using html, vanilla JS and CSS with Tailwind </h1>

Hello! It's me, JackFrost again.

- Today, after a few projects using tailwind, i had a much better understanding of it in comparison to a few days ago. 
- This project went much smoother than what i expected. As a fun experience, i tried doing the dark/light theme button. 
- It does function, but i am still confused about which part of the grid card's color should be changed so ended up leaving it from now.
- I was struggled a while with the color assignment in tailwind config, as the customized color didn't get applied on to the JSON data files, 
so i ended up assigned those color onto input.css file.
- Overall this was a really entertained challenge to do, i had learnt a lot during completing it.
